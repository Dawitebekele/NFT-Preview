### Continued development

- Need to strengthen understanding of CSS and it's various applications to create the product I want. You can accomplish the same thing with different variables but later on these can hinder you from doing what you wanna do. So it's important to make a roadmap and understand what each variable does.

### Useful resources

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bGbykdR4T8 I had to use this step by step guide to rectify my version of the design. After a couple days of getting stuck on how to keep the size of the NFT between mobile and desktop views, this guide really helped me.
